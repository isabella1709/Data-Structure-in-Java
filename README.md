# Data Structure in Java

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in Java. Each data structure is organized in its own directory for easy exploration and learning.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **Binary Tree**: Implementation of binary trees, including basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

- **Circular Queue**: Implementation of circular queues, demonstrating efficient use of arrays for cyclic storage.

- **Linked List**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists, including operations like addition, deletion, and search.

- **Stacks**: Stack implementations using arrays and linked lists, supporting operations such as push, pop, and top.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
